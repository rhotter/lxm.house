Welcome to our house, Light and Matter! Living with others brings so much joy to our lives.

### Address

1805 Broadway, San Francisco CA, 94109 ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WECCW8LoLE4NFbkD9))

### Getting in

People are home most of the time, so you can knock at the front. You can also come in via the garage. Once you come in, you can take a set of keys at the front entrance.

Message us for the garage code.

### Sharing the room

Because many people are sharing the guest room, we ask that you respect quiet hours in that room after 10pm. Please unpack before then (or outside it if you arrive afterwards), and please gently close the guest room door after that time. Showering or typing during quiet hours is alright. If you snore loudly, please let us know that you'd like to stay in Squeezetown instead!

### Be a host

Weâ€™d love if you could, from time-to-time, help with things around the house like loading/unloading the dishwasher, taking out the trash, etc.

We have plenty of mattresses, sheets, towels, and earplugs for you to use. Before leaving, please put your sheets and towel in the laundry bin in the guest room, and please return your house keys to the front entrance.

### Hot Cocoa ++

On Wednesday nights at 8 pm, we get together as a house and have (Italian-style) hot chocolate together. You should come!
