# Light and Matter

Welcome to our house! Stay for a week in the heart of San Francisco and work on the things you're curious about in a focused yet stimulating environment. We combine the intellectual rigor of Boston with the courage of the Bay Area.

We're a rotating home for researchers, students, and people with ideas.

Reach out to stay with us if you're interested!
