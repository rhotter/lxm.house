## Light and Matter

Welcome to our house! Stay for a week in the heart of San Francisco and work on the things you're curious about in a focused yet stimulating environment. We combine the intellectual rigor of Boston with the courage of the Bay Area.

We're a rotating home for researchers, students, and people with ideas.

[Rea](mailto:aayushgupta05@gmail.com)[ch ](mailto:marleyxiong0@gmail.com)[out](https://twitter.com/raffi_hotter) to stay with us if you're interested! Or to come for a hot cocoa night!

<div className="border border-gray-200 px-4 my-8 text-gray-500">
How can you image deeper than 1 mm in the brain with light? ⟡ Why do neurons fire spontaneously? ⟡ How can pseudonymity change how we govern ourselves? ⟡ Can you simulate [Cheerios in the browser](https://amazing-phoenix-5fccfc.netlify.app/)?
