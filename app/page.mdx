## Light and Matter

Welcome to our house! Stay for a week in the heart of San Francisco and work on the things you're curious about in a focused yet stimulating environment. We combine the intellectual rigor of Boston with the courage of the Bay Area.

We're a rotating home for researchers, students, and people with ideas.

[Rea](mailto:aayushgupta05@gmail.com)[ch ](mailto:marleyxiong0@gmail.com)[out](https://twitter.com/raffi_hotter) to stay with us if you're interested!
